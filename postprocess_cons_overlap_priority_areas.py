Conservation priorities overlap analysis:
1) how much of high value ES area (top 10% map) is outside of current
   protected area (PAs) network? Then,
2) overlap the areas of top 10% outside of the PA with KBAs and answer:
    2a) How much of high value ES area would be priorities for protection or
        restoration for ES?

Desired output: maps, % values
Inputs to use:
PH PAs: './data/protected_areas/PH_Combined_PAs'
IDN PAs: './data/protected_areas/ID_Combined PAs'
IDN KBAs: './data/protected_areas/Indonesia_KBA'
